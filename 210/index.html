            Coding bootcamps are short, intensive training coding programs and tech courses that give students the
            skills they need for new careers in technology. Programming bootcamps and code schools like BrainStation
            have become an increasingly popular alternative to a four-year computer science degree, allowing
            students to gain real-world experience under the instruction of top industry professionals.
  
            While "coding bootcamps" as a term has come to be used for digital skills training across disciplines,
            including courses and programs relating to web development, software development, data science, UX
            design, and digital marketing, the term originally was meant to describe short-term, intensive training
            programs in full-stack web development, software development, or software engineering.
  
            As one of the best coding bootcamps, BrainStation provides hands-on, project-based learning, allowing
            students with no prior experience to learn how to use programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            Python, SQL, and more.
  
            The goal of our coding bootcamps is to prepare you for a new career in web development, software
            development and engineering, data science, design, security, digital marketing, or related tech fields.
            To that end, bootcamp graduates also benefit from ongoing, personalized career services meant to provide
            guidance and support during the job search.

        <p>
            Coding bootcamps work by giving students hands-on experience with the key programming languages, knowledge areas, and technical skills needed for a career in technology.
  
            The best coding bootcamps are taught by experienced professionals who know what employers are looking for. Many bootcamp students are looking to change careers, so the best bootcamps help with the job search, including career services, a network of hiring partners, and opportunities to build professional networks through events and guest lectures.
            
            Ultimately, coding bootcamp students learn the skills and develop the project portfolio necessary to land a job in web and software development, software engineering, data science, UX design, digital marketing, or other tech fields.

        <p>
            When trying to determine your tech career path, the first step is to understand where your interests and passions truly lie. Do you have a good sense of computer science fundamentals? Are you excited about the idea of building a website? Take a look at full-stack web development and the kinds of careers you can have after taking a web development bootcamp. Are you good with numbers and like identifying trends (that would have remained hidden)? A career in data science might be for you. Asking yourself questions like these will help guide your job search and the kind of training you need.
  
            From there, take stock of the skills and experience you currently have – whether or not they are in computer science. Is there any overlap with skills that are most in demand? Does your education and professional experience lend itself to an emerging field like data science, software, development, or digital marketing?

        </h5>
        <p>
            BrainStation's coding bootcamps generally take three months to complete on a full-time basis — 12 weeks.
  
            In that time, you will develop a comprehensive understanding of web development, data science, user experience design, or digital marketing fundamentals, and learn how to apply these new skills and knowledge. BrainStation bootcamps are immersive and project-based, allowing you to build a portfolio of completed projects by the end of the bootcamp.
            
            For students seeking more flexibility, BrainStation also offers part-time bootcamps, which are completed over eight months.

            Tuition for full-time coding bootcamps can vary depending on the field of study, the location of the campus, the method of study chosen (online or in-person), or how comprehensive the course is.
            Some programming bootcamps and code schools could be relatively inexpensive or quick to complete, but might not cover the full range of skills and competencies needed, especially for students interested in full-stack web development.
